This is a project I created as selection for Bersinar Project Front-end Developer. 

## Installation
After clone, run:
```
npm install
```

Then run:
```
npm run dev
```

and the project will run in the localhost.

At this point, you can create anonymous message as much as you can. Then you can click the Log In button on the top corner, which will require Google Account to log in and see the Admin panel. As an Admin, you can see and delete the messages. If a message deleted, it would not be appeared on the homepage.
